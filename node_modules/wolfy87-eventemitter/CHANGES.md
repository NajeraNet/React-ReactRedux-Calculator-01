# v5.2.0

 * Merge [#130](https://github.com/Olical/EventEmitter/pull/130) - Add TypeScript declarations.
 * Small tweaks around the repo to update documentation and fix links.

# v5.1.0 - And everything before that.

 * I didn't keep a change log because I'm lazy and this project is old. I've been maintaining it since I started my career, essentially.
